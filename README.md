ActionMailer::Text
==================

Automatically insert a text/plain part into your HTML multipart e-mails.

### This version of actionmailer-text uses Nokogiri to parse html, to use the original version go [here](https://github.com/dblock/actionmailer-text)

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'actionmailer-textgiri'
```

## Usage

```ruby
class WelcomeMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  include ActionMailer::Text

  default from: 'welcome@example.org'

  def welcome(user)
    @user = user
    mail(to: @user.email, subject: 'Welcome!') do |format|
      format.html { render 'welcome' }
    end
  end
end

```

## Details

The MIME standard allows systems to send e-mail with multiple parts: plain/text for business-efficient devices such as the Blackberry, and text/html for web-based e-mail readers, such as GMail. Furthermore, ActionMailer supports multiple template formats: create an .html.haml template along with a .txt.haml template to generate both. We also know that text/plain email helps deliverability, but we believe a disproportionately small amount of text e-mails are actually read - the vast majority of devices are capable of parsing some HTML. This gem lets you get the text/plain part for free.
